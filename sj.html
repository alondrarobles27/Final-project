					 she lit matches to help herself find the boys room. The boys then died after 
					 breathing in too much of the smoke in their sleep. The mother than accused trina of 
					 starting the fire intentionally. Trina was then left traumatized. Trinas lawyer then 
					 failed to file the proper motions which would have then pushed back the trial until she 
					 was well enough to speak in the trial her lawyer also didn't even challenge the fact that 
					 she was being tried as an adult. In prison she was then raped and had to give birth chained 
					 to her bed. Even after that her son was taken away from her.
