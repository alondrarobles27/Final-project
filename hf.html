<div class="item-23">In the 1700s laws didn't differentaiate between juveniles and adults within the criminal
                     system. This means many young kids were being sentenced in adult criminals courts
					 soon changed in the late 19th century.In the 1960's the supreme court made more decisions
					 to formalize juvenile courts and more formal hearing requirment for youth to be transfered 
					 to adult court.Then in the late 1980's the public thought that juvenile crime was rising 
					 and the legal system was to lenient,because of this many states passed more laws causing 
					 juveniles to automatically be transeferred to adult court for certian crimes being 
					 committed </div>
